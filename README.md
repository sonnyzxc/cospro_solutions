# What is COS Pro?
**COS (Coding Specialist) Pro** is an exam hosted by [YBM IT](https://www.ybmit.com/). Exams are CBT (Computer Based Test) and are held in-person an a YBT testing centre. There are multiple testing centre (located throughout South Korea) and dates throughout the year.

Currently, there are 3 levels that you can take:
- 1급 (Grade 1) --> Python, Java, C++, C
- 2급 (Grade 2) --> Python, Java, C++, C
- 3급 (Grade 3) --> C++

1급 or Grade 1 is the highest (thus hardest) grade.

The exams are out of 1000 and consist of 10 questions. For Grade 1, there are 3 full questions (you will have to write code from scratch) and 7 partial questions (where you either have to change a line to debug or fill in blanks).

Upon passing the exam (i.e. by scoring >60%), you will receive a pass certificate.
